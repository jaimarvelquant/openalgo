## Section Results

### Document Structure
**Pass Rate:** 7/8 (87.5%)

**✓ PASS** - Title includes story id and title  
Evidence: Line 1: `# Story 2.1: OpenAlgo to MarvelQuant Rebranding - Phase 1 (Logo & Documentation)`

**✓ PASS** - Status set to Draft (or ContextReadyDraft)  
Evidence: Line 3: `Status: ContextReadyDraft`

**✓ PASS** - Story section present with As a / I want / so that  
Evidence: Lines 7-9 contain complete user story format with all three components

**✓ PASS** - Acceptance Criteria is a numbered list  
Evidence: Lines 13-37 contain 5 numbered acceptance criteria with titles and detailed descriptions

**✓ PASS** - Tasks/Subtasks present with checkboxes  
Evidence: Lines 41-157 contain 10 major tasks with 60+ subtasks, all with checkboxes and AC references

**✓ PASS** - Dev Notes includes architecture/testing context  
Evidence: Lines 161-217 contain comprehensive Dev Notes with Architecture Patterns & Constraints, Project Structure Notes, and References

**⚠ PARTIAL** - Change Log table initialized  
Evidence: Line 219 shows "Change Log" section header but no table structure  
Gap: Missing table with columns for Date, Version, Changes, Author  
Impact: Minor - can be added during implementation

**✓ PASS** - Dev Agent Record sections present  
Evidence: Lines 219-235 contain all required sections: Context Reference (with link to story-context-2.1.xml), Agent Model Used, Debug Log References, Completion Notes List, File List

---

### Content Quality
**Pass Rate:** 4/4 (100%)

**✓ PASS** - Acceptance Criteria sourced from epics/PRD  
Evidence: All ACs sourced from `docs/bmad/research/phase1-rebranding-analysis.md` (referenced at line 211). ACs align with analysis document's requirements: 8 logo files, 35 HTML files, 104 MD files, domain migration, verification.

**✓ PASS** - Tasks reference AC numbers where applicable  
Evidence: All 10 tasks include AC references in parentheses (e.g., Task 1: `(AC: #5)`, Task 4: `(AC: #2, #3)`)

**✓ PASS** - Dev Notes do not invent details; cite sources where possible  
Evidence: Lines 211-217 provide detailed source citations including primary source document with specific sections, logo source file location, testing standards, and rollback strategy all sourced from analysis document. No invented technical details.

**✓ PASS** - File saved to stories directory from config  
Evidence: File located at `docs/bmad/stories/story-2.1.md`, matching config `dev_story_location: '{project-root}/docs/bmad/stories'`

**✓ PASS** - Epic enumeration verification  
Evidence: New epic (Epic 2) for rebranding project based on comprehensive analysis document (`phase1-rebranding-analysis.md`). Story creation explicitly requested by user with context document provided. No need to run `*correct-course`.

---

### Optional Post-Generation
**Pass Rate:** 2/2 (100%)

**✓ PASS** - Story Context generation run  
Evidence: Story context XML generated at `bmad/docs/story-context-2.1.xml` with comprehensive context including metadata, acceptance criteria, artifacts (docs and code), dependencies, constraints, interfaces, and 8 test ideas.

**✓ PASS** - Context Reference recorded in story  
Evidence: Line 221: `- [Story Context XML](../../bmad/docs/story-context-2.1.xml) - Generated 2025-10-09`

## Failed Items

*None*

## Partial Items

### ⚠ Change Log table initialized

**What's Missing:** The Change Log section (line 219) exists but doesn't include the typical table structure with columns for Date, Version, Changes, and Author.

**Recommendation:** Add a table structure like:
```markdown
## Change Log

| Date | Version | Changes | Author |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| 2025-10-09 | 1.0 | Initial story creation | Bob (Scrum Master) |
```

**Impact:** Low - This is a minor documentation issue that doesn't affect story implementation.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Must Fix
*None - No critical failures*

### 2. Should Improve
- **Add Change Log table structure** - Include a proper markdown table with Date, Version, Changes, and Author columns for tracking story evolution

### 3. Consider
- The story is exceptionally well-documented with comprehensive task breakdown (60+ subtasks)
- Story context XML is thorough with 8 test ideas covering both automated and manual testing
- Consider this story as a template for future rebranding phases (Phase 2, 3, etc.)
- The story demonstrates excellent traceability from requirements (phase1-rebranding-analysis.md) through acceptance criteria to detailed tasks

---

## Quality Highlights

1. **Comprehensive Task Breakdown:** 10 major tasks with 60+ subtasks, all mapped to acceptance criteria
2. **Excellent Source Documentation:** All requirements traced to phase1-rebranding-analysis.md with specific section references
3. **Detailed Dev Notes:** Includes risk level, constraints, replacement order, automation strategy, and rollback procedures
4. **Complete Story Context:** Generated XML includes 9 code artifacts, 5 documentation artifacts, dependency information, 10 constraints, 4 interfaces, and 8 test ideas
5. **Clear Acceptance Criteria:** 5 specific, measurable criteria with detailed descriptions
6. **Safety-First Approach:** Includes dry-run mode, backups, verification scripts, and rollback strategies

---

## Conclusion

**Story 2.1 PASSES validation with a 91.7% score.**

The story is **ready for implementation** with only one minor documentation improvement recommended (Change Log table structure). The story demonstrates exceptional quality in:
- Requirements traceability
- Task decomposition
- Technical documentation
- Safety and verification procedures

This story can serve as a template for future rebranding phases and demonstrates best practices for BMAD story creation.
