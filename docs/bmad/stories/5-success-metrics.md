## Epic 2 Success Metrics (Event-Driven Pilot - Future)

**Note:** Epic 2 metrics will be defined in a separate epic document after Epic 1 completion. Preliminary success criteria include:

**Pilot Success Criteria (2 brokers: Jainam + Zerodha):**
- [ ] Order status latency <500ms (vs. current 1-2 seconds)
- [ ] System stability maintained (>99.9% uptime)
- [ ] Event processing error rate <0.1%
- [ ] User satisfaction improved (+20% in surveys)
- [ ] API call reduction >50% for order status checks
- [ ] No critical bugs in 1 month of production use

**Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:**
- Expand to more brokers: All pilot success criteria met
- Refine and re-evaluate: Partial success (50-80% of criteria met)
- Rollback to REST only: Success criteria not met (<50%)
