# 4. Epic and Story Structure

## 4.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision:** Single comprehensive epic

**Rationale:**
For this brownfield enhancement, all work contributes to a single objectiveâ€”making the Jainam Prop broker integration production-ready. The 6 missing functions, database integration, and security fixes are interdependent parts of one deliverable. A single epic provides better traceability, makes dependencies explicit, and clearly indicates when the integration is complete.
