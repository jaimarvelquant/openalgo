status_reason: >
  List payloads now bypass the `.get(...)` crash path, execution time logging is
  in place, and the dedicated pytest suite exercises long/short/not-found/error
  scenarios successfully.

top_issues:
  - Watch: Input validation is implicit; keep call sites supplying normalized strings to avoid false negatives.

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: No auth or credential handling changes introduced by this story.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: `_finish(...)` instrumentation records duration on every path; runtime limited by upstream API call.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: List/dict payload handling and exception guards cover the smart-order dependency scenarios.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Comprehensive pytest suite (20 cases) protects regressions across payload variations.
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: Add lightweight input normalization/validation to warn on empty/None parameters before lookup.
