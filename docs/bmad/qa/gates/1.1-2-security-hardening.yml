  Import path now loads cleanly and the latency benchmark enforces <10 ms avg/<15 ms
  p95 thresholds, allowing AC2/IV1/IV3 to be validated by the automated suites.

    notes: test_authentication_latency_thresholds enforces <10 ms average and <15 ms p95 across 50 iterations.
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: Env-sourced credentials plus error-message assertions prevent leakage under failure (`broker/jainam_prop/test_auth.py`, `broker/jainam_prop/test_auth_isolated.py`).
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Automated latency thresholds guard regression (`broker/jainam_prop/test_auth_benchmark.py`).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Import succeeds and mocked flows cover success and failure cases (`broker/jainam_prop/test_auth.py`).
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Patterns align with other brokers; documentation remains current.
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: Reintroduce token persistence when the shared database helper is available to restore session caching.
