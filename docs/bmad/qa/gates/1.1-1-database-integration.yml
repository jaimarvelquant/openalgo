gate: PASS
status_reason: Pytest suite (python3 -m pytest test/broker/jainam_prop -q on 2025-10-07)
  and benchmark evidence validate AC1-AC6; CDS/BFO routing exercises map_exchange_to_jainam
  and cached token lookup remains <100 ms with documented results (docs/bmad/qa/evidence/story-1.1-1-token-lookup-latency.md).

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: SQLAlchemy parameter binding prevents direct injection; no new secrets
      stored.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Cached lookups benchmarked at <0.001 ms per call against a 120k instrument
      dataset (docs/bmad/qa/evidence/story-1.1-1-token-lookup-latency.md).
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Regression suite exercises transform_data and persistence against temp
      databases; CDS/BFO mappings validated.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Dedicated tests protect segment mappings and token persistence; code follows
      existing module layout.
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
  - action: Monitor cached token lookup latency in staging/production releases to
      ensure continued compliance with the 100 ms SLA.
