gate: PASS
status_reason: >
  Smart order payload validation, delta/action routing, latency instrumentation, and error
  handling satisfy AC1â€“AC6, while the broadened pytest suite now covers all IV2 scenarios
  and asserts the latency metadata required for IV3.

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: No new authentication or credential surface introduced by smart-order changes.
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: Latency metadata is captured for every smart order and warning logs flag breaches of the 10 second SLA.
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Unit tests now exercise opening, increasing, reducing, flattening, reversing, and no-change flows.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: Implementation follows existing broker patterns and has focused unit tests for core flows.
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: Monitor production smart-order logs for repeated latency warnings to catch upstream slowdowns early.
