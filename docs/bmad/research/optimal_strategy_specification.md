## Strategy Logic

### Strategy Type: Short Strangle

A **Short Strangle** involves:
1. **Sell OTM Call**: Sell a call option above the current index level
2. **Sell OTM Put**: Sell a put option below the current index level

**Profit Mechanism**:
- Collect premium from both options
- Profit if index stays within the range (between the two strikes)
- Maximum profit = Total premium collected
- Maximum loss = Unlimited (theoretically)

**Risk Profile**:
- **Limited Profit**: Premium collected
- **Unlimited Risk**: If index moves significantly in either direction
- **Breakeven**: Strike ± Premium collected

### Strike Selection Logic

**Strike Range**: 930-1030 points from current index level

**Interpretation**:
- **Call Strike**: Current Index + 930 to 1030 points (OTM)
- **Put Strike**: Current Index - 930 to 1030 points (OTM)

**Example** (from Jan 3, 2024):
- Index at Entry: 21,624.65
- Call Strike: 21,600 (24.65 points ITM - unusual, likely ATM at entry)
- Put Strike: 21,600 (24.65 points ITM - unusual, likely ATM at entry)

**⚠️ NOTE**: The strike selection seems to be **ATM (At-The-Money)** rather than OTM based on the data. This suggests the strategy might be a **Short Straddle** (ATM) rather than a **Short Strangle** (OTM).

**Revised Interpretation**:
- The "930-1030" might refer to a different parameter (e.g., time range, premium range, or strike offset)
- Need to verify with the original strategy code

### Expiry Selection

**Expiry**: Next day expiry (weekly options)

**Example**:
- Entry Date: 2024-01-03 (Wednesday)
- Expiry Date: 2024-01-04 (Thursday)

**Rationale**:
- Very short time to expiry (1 day)
- High theta decay (time decay works in favor of option sellers)
- Lower risk of large index moves in 1 day

---

## Entry Rules

### Entry Time

**Time**: 9:30 AM IST (Market Open)

**Rationale**:
- Enter at market open to capture opening volatility
- Avoid overnight risk
- Intraday strategy

### Entry Conditions

1. **Market Open**: Enter at 9:30 AM sharp
2. **Strike Selection**: Select ATM or near-ATM strikes (based on data)
3. **Expiry**: Next day expiry (weekly options)
4. **Quantity**: 75 lots per leg (150 lots total)

### Entry Process

1. **At 9:30 AM**:
   - Identify current NIFTY index level
   - Select Call strike (ATM or slightly OTM)
   - Select Put strike (ATM or slightly OTM)
   - Sell Call option (75 lots)
   - Sell Put option (75 lots)

2. **Record Entry Prices**:
   - Call Entry Price
   - Put Entry Price
   - Index Level at Entry

3. **Calculate Stop-Loss Levels**:
   - Call Stop-Loss = Entry Price × 1.29 (29% above entry)
   - Put Stop-Loss = Entry Price × 1.29 (29% above entry)

---

## Exit Rules

### Exit Conditions

**Exit if ANY of the following conditions are met:**

1. **Time-Based Exit**: 10:30 AM (1 hour after entry)
2. **Stop-Loss Hit**: Option price increases by 29% from entry
3. **Target Hit**: (Not specified in data, likely no target)

### Exit Process

**1. Time-Based Exit (10:30 AM)**:
- Close both legs at market price
- Record exit prices and PnL

**2. Stop-Loss Exit**:
- If Call price increases by 29%:
  - Close Call leg immediately
  - Keep Put leg open until 10:30 AM or its stop-loss
- If Put price increases by 29%:
  - Close Put leg immediately
  - Keep Call leg open until 10:30 AM or its stop-loss

**3. Both Legs Stop-Loss**:
- If both legs hit stop-loss before 10:30 AM:
  - Close both legs
  - Exit strategy for the day

### Exit Examples (from Backtest)

**Example 1 (Jan 3, 2024)**:
- Call: Exit at 10:30 AM (Exit Time Hit) - Profit
- Put: Exit at 9:41 AM (Stop Loss Hit) - Loss
- Net: Profit (₹478.75)

**Example 2 (Jan 17, 2024)**:
- Call: Exit at 10:30 AM (Exit Time Hit) - Profit
- Put: Exit at 10:30 AM (Exit Time Hit) - Profit
- Net: Profit (₹1,803.12)

---

## Risk Management

### Stop-Loss

**Stop-Loss Level**: 29% above entry price

**Calculation**:
- Call Stop-Loss Price = Call Entry Price × 1.29
- Put Stop-Loss Price = Put Entry Price × 1.29

**Example** (Jan 3, 2024 - Put):
- Entry Price: 71.05
- Stop-Loss Price: 71.05 × 1.29 = 91.65
- Actual Exit: 91.65 (Stop-Loss Hit)
- Loss: -₹1,557.54

**Rationale**:
- 29% stop-loss allows for some adverse movement
- Prevents catastrophic losses
- Balances risk and reward

### Position Sizing

**Quantity**: 75 lots per leg (150 lots total)

**Lot Size**: 75 (NIFTY options lot size)

**Total Quantity**: 75 lots × 75 units/lot = 5,625 units per leg

**Margin Required**: ₹536,834.63

**Margin per Lot**: ₹536,834.63 / 150 lots = ₹3,578.90 per lot

### Maximum Loss per Trade

**Maximum Loss per Leg**:
- Call: Entry Price × 1.29 - Entry Price = Entry Price × 0.29
- Put: Entry Price × 1.29 - Entry Price = Entry Price × 0.29

**Example** (Jan 24, 2024 - Call):
- Entry Price: 123.70
- Stop-Loss Price: 123.70 × 1.29 = 159.57
- Maximum Loss: (159.57 - 123.70) × 75 lots × 75 units = ₹2,711.72
- Actual Loss: ₹2,711.72 (Stop-Loss Hit)

### Maximum Drawdown

**Max Drawdown**: -₹167.68 (very low)

**Max Drawdown %**: -0.03% (negligible)

**Days to Recover**: 7 days

**Rationale**:
- Very low drawdown indicates strong risk management
- Fast recovery time
- Strategy is resilient

## Migration Considerations

### Challenge: Market Incompatibility

**Current Market**: Indian Markets (NIFTY Index Options)  
**QuantConnect Lean**: Does NOT support Indian markets

**Options**:

1. **Keep in OpenAlgo** (RECOMMENDED)
   - Deploy to OpenAlgo with Jainam broker
   - No need to adapt strategy
   - Same market, same characteristics

2. **Adapt to US Markets** (SPX/SPY)
   - Convert to SPX/SPY options
   - Adjust strike selection for different index levels
   - Adjust position sizing for different option prices
   - Test in QuantConnect Lean

### Adaptation to US Markets (SPX/SPY)

**If migrating to US markets:**

**Strike Selection Adjustment**:
- NIFTY: ~21,500 level
- SPX: ~4,500 level (5x smaller)
- SPY: ~450 level (50x smaller)

**Adjusted Strike Range**:
- NIFTY: 930-1030 points → SPX: 186-206 points → SPY: 18.6-20.6 points

**Position Sizing Adjustment**:
- NIFTY: 75 lots × 75 units = 5,625 units
- SPX: 1 contract = 100 units → 56 contracts
- SPY: 1 contract = 100 units → 56 contracts

**Margin Adjustment**:
- NIFTY: ₹536,834.63 (~$6,500 USD)
- SPX: ~$30,000 USD (higher margin for SPX)
- SPY: ~$6,000 USD (similar to NIFTY)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Use SPY (not SPX) for similar capital requirements.
