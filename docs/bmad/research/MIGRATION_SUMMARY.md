## Critical Challenge: Market Incompatibility

### The Problem

**Custom Backtester**: Uses NIFTY Index Options (Indian Markets - NSE)  
**QuantConnect Lean**: Does NOT support Indian markets

**What Lean Supports**:
- ‚úÖ US Markets (Equities, Options, Futures)
- ‚úÖ Forex
- ‚úÖ Crypto
- ‚úÖ European Markets (limited)
- ‚ùå **Indian Markets (NSE/BSE)**

**What Lean Does NOT Support**:
- ‚ùå NIFTY Index Options
- ‚ùå Indian broker integrations (Zerodha, Upstox, Jainam)
- ‚ùå NSE market hours
- ‚ùå Indian options symbol format

### The Solution: Two Paths

**Path A: OpenAlgo (Indian Markets)** ‚Üê RECOMMENDED  
**Path B: QuantConnect Lean (US Markets)**

---

## Path A: OpenAlgo (Indian Markets) - RECOMMENDED

### Overview

**Keep the strategy as-is and deploy to OpenAlgo with Indian brokers.**

### Pros

‚úÖ **No Strategy Adaptation**: Use exact same strategy  
‚úÖ **Same Market**: NIFTY options, same characteristics  
‚úÖ **Lower Capital**: ‚Çπ5.4 lakhs margin vs. $30k+ for SPX  
‚úÖ **Familiar Market**: Same volatility, trading hours  
‚úÖ **Faster Deployment**: 1-2 weeks vs. 3-4 weeks  
‚úÖ **Lower Risk**: No need to re-test in different market  

### Cons

‚ùå **Cannot Use Lean**: Miss out on Lean's features  
‚ùå **Limited Brokers**: Jainam (implemented), Zerodha (planned)  
‚ùå **Manual Implementation**: Need to implement options chain filtering, Greeks, etc.  

### Implementation Steps
