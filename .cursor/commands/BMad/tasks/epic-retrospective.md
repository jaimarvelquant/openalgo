# Epic Retrospective Task

## Purpose

Conduct a structured retrospective for a completed epic to identify what went well, what could be improved, and capture lessons learned for future epics. This task creates actionable insights and process improvements based on the epic's execution.

## When to Use

Use this task after:
- Epic has been validated as complete
- All stories are Done and quality gates approved
- Team has time to reflect on the epic execution
- Before planning the next epic

## Prerequisites

- Epic completion validation completed
- Epic completion report available
- Team members available for input
- Historical data from epic execution

## Task Execution

### 1. Gather Epic Data

**Input Collection:**

- Time tracking and effort data
- Team feedback and observations

**Timeline Analysis:**
- Planned vs actual completion time
- Story cycle times (creation ‚Üí Done)
- QA review cycle times
- Bottleneck identification

### 2. Structured Retrospective Format

**Four L's Framework:**
- **Liked:** What went well
- **Learned:** New insights and discoveries
- **Lacked:** What was missing or inadequate
- **Longed for:** What we wished we had

**Alternative: Sailboat Retrospective:**

## Integration Points

### Workflow Integration
- Follows epic completion validation
- Precedes next epic planning
- Feeds into process improvement initiatives
- Updates organizational learning database

### Document Relationships
- **Epic Completion Report:** Source data for retrospective
- **Story Files:** Individual story outcomes and lessons
- **QA Assessments:** Quality findings and trends
- **Team Feedback:** Qualitative insights and observations

## Best Practices

### Facilitation
- Neutral facilitator (not team lead)
- Include all team members and stakeholders
- Time-box discussions to stay focused
- Use data to support opinions, not replace discussion

### Data Collection
- Gather metrics before retrospective
- Prepare timeline visualizations
- Have specific examples ready
- Balance quantitative and qualitative data

### Action Item Creation
- Focus on high-impact, feasible improvements
- Avoid too many action items (aim for 5-8)
- Ensure accountability and follow-through
- Link actions to specific problems identified

### Follow-through
- Schedule regular check-ins on action items
- Celebrate completed improvements
- Adjust approach based on results
- Share learnings across teams

## Common Retrospective Anti-patterns

### Avoid These Traps
- **Blame Game:** Focus on process, not people
- **No Action Items:** Every issue needs a solution approach
- **Too Many Actions:** Quality over quantity
- **No Data:** Use metrics to inform discussions
- **No Follow-up:** Actions without tracking are worthless

### Signs of Poor Retrospective
- Same issues raised repeatedly
- No measurable improvements over time
- Low team engagement or participation
- Action items never completed
- Focus only on problems, no celebration of wins

## Command Integration

This task integrates with PO agent workflow:
- `*epic-retrospective {epic-id}` - Execute this task
- Follows `*validate-epic-completion {epic-id}`
- Precedes `*create-next-epic` or project completion

## Success Metrics

- **Participation:** All key team members contribute
- **Insights Generated:** Clear patterns and root causes identified
- **Action Items:** Specific, measurable, achievable improvements
- **Follow-through:** Action items completed and effective
- **Continuous Improvement:** Process evolves based on learnings
