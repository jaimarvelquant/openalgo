## üéØ Research Objective

Identify and research new parameters that should be added to the backtester system through comprehensive gap analysis and industry benchmarking. The goal is to create a prioritized list of missing parameters with complete implementation specifications that will bring the system to professional trading platform standards.

---

## üìã Context and Background

### Project Overview

We are integrating a Python-based algorithmic trading backtester with MarvelQuant (a Flask-based multi-broker trading platform) to enable live trading execution. While the current `Util.py` module contains 100+ parameters, there are significant gaps when compared to:

1. **Column Mappings**: Parameters defined in Excel column mappings but not fully implemented in code
2. **Input Sheet Definitions**: Parameters present in historical input sheets but lacking backend logic
3. **Industry Standards**: Parameters that professional platforms (QuantConnect, TradeStation, Interactive Brokers) provide but our system lacks
4. **Live Trading Requirements**: Parameters needed specifically for real-time execution that weren't necessary for backtesting

### Current System Gaps

**Known Gap Categories**:

1. **Advanced Order Types**: Current system supports basic market orders; missing limit, stop-limit, OCO, bracket, iceberg, TWAP, VWAP orders
2. **Portfolio-Level Risk**: Limited portfolio-level risk management; missing correlation-based limits, sector exposure limits, concentration limits
3. **Market Regime Detection**: No parameters for detecting and adapting to market regimes (trending, ranging, high volatility, low volatility)
4. **Execution Quality**: No parameters for slippage modeling, market impact estimation, fill probability, execution algorithms
5. **Performance Tracking**: Limited performance metrics; missing Sharpe ratio targets, Sortino ratio, Calmar ratio, drawdown limits, recovery time tracking
6. **Dynamic Adjustments**: No parameters for dynamic strategy adjustments based on performance, market conditions, or time of day
7. **Multi-Timeframe Analysis**: Limited support for multi-timeframe strategies; missing parameters for timeframe synchronization
8. **Greeks Management**: For options strategies, missing delta, gamma, theta, vega targets and limits
9. **Liquidity Management**: No parameters for liquidity checks, bid-ask spread limits, volume requirements
10. **Commission and Fees**: Basic expense calculation; missing detailed commission structures, exchange fees, regulatory fees

### Integration Goals

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Fill all gaps between current implementation and industry standards
2. **Live Trading Readiness**: Add parameters essential for real-time execution safety
3. **Excel/JSON Compatibility**: All new parameters must map cleanly to dual-format configuration
4. **Backward Compatibility**: New parameters should be optional with sensible defaults
5. **Validation Framework**: Each new parameter must have complete validation rules
